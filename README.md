<h1 align="center">Using dgraph with Prowl</h1>

If you're now familiar with dgraph, visit their website at https://dgraph.io/. Look through their documentation, but in this instance, this documentation will be walking you through how to install what you need for this to run on the Prowl framework, and to get it running. 

First access the Prowl VPS that all Prowl employees should haves access to. Make sure it's running the right kernel you can do this by running 

<pre>uname</pre>

I suggest you use these flags when running uname 

<pre>m, o</pre>

So the command should be

<pre>uname -mo</pre>

It obviously should be running the same kernel, since the VPS is the same all accross the board for each Prowl employee.
